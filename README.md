CSV Import (plugin for Omeka) [fork]
=============================


Summary
-------

Allows users to import items from a simple CSV (comma separated values) file,
and then map the CSV column data to multiple elements, files, and/or tags. Each
row in the file represents metadata for a single item. This plugin is useful
for exporting data from one database and importing that data into an Omeka site.

This plugin is a fork of the original plugin that allows import of metadata of
files.

For more information on Omeka, see [Omeka][1].


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "CsvImport".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your database so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on [GitHub][2] (original plugin) and [GitHub][3] (fork).
